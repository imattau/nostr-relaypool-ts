# Nostr RelayPool Web Worker Example

This example demonstrates how to use `RelayPoolWorker` to offload heavy Nostr event processing (signature verification, filter matching, etc.) to a background thread.

## Why use a Web Worker?

Nostr can be very chatty. Verifying signatures for hundreds of events per second on the main thread can cause "jank" or UI freezes, leading to a poor user experience. By using a Web Worker, the main thread remains free to handle animations and user input smoothly.

## How to run

1.  Ensure you have built the library first:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  Install dependencies in this directory (or use a global vite):
    ```bash
    npm install vite
    npx vite
    ```
3.  Open the provided URL in your browser.

## Key Files

- `index.html`: Simple UI with a main-thread animation.
- `main.ts`: Initializes `RelayPoolWorker` and manages the subscription.
- `../../lib/nostr-relaypool.worker.js`: The built worker code (generated by `npm run build`).
